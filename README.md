# Sublight Planets

A toy planet generator I made to help me, and now others learn 2D shaders.

Play with It On [fritzy.itch.io/sublight-planets](https://fritzy.itch.io/sublight-planets).

## Purpose

I wrote this originally to learn 2D shaders.
But now I'd like to see others use it to learn, or even use it in it's entirety in it's own project.
If there's enough interest, I'd be happy to convert it on add-on so that you may more easily include these celestial bodies as backdrops in your own projects.
